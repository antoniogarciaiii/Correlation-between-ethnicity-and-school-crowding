# Correlation-between-ethnicity-and-school-crowding
This study aims to concretely show the overcrowding occuring in schools with predominantly students of color. 

## Author's observations
Much to my suspicions, the community areas with the highest overcrowding have significantly higher poropertions of students of color. There are some overcrowded community areas with a high amount of White students. However, I would like to see further data about this, such as subests of varying levels of "whiteness/assimilation." Are these recent immigrants from Europe, for example, or are these third generation families?

Speaking from a demographic standpoint, specific information regarding immigration backstory are sometimes lost during the assimilation to "American Whiteness." As another example, Latinx soldiers who served in World War II were registered as White. This is not an attempt to deconsctruct "whiteness," but rather, better understand school crowding using limited socioeconomic and demographic data.
